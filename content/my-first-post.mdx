## IS THIS WORKING H2
First, let's create a file at `src/count-context.js` and we'll create our
context there:

`console.log("hello inline code!!!") `

```jsx
// src/count-context.js
import * as React from 'react'

const CountStateContext = React.createContext()
const CountDispatchContext = React.createContext()
```

First off, I don't have an initial value for the `CountStateContext`. If I
wanted an initial value, I would call `React.createContext({count: 0})`. But I
don't include a default value and that's intentional. The `defaultValue` is only
useful in a situation like this:

```jsx
function CountDisplay() {
  const {count} = React.useContext(CountStateContext)
  return <div>{count}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(<CountDisplay />, document.getElementById('⚛️'))
```

Because we don't have a default value for our `CountStateContext`, we'll get an
error on the highlighted line where we're destructing the return value of
`useContext`. This is because our default value is `undefined` and you cannot
destructure `undefined`.

None of us likes runtime errors, so your knee-jerk reaction may be to add a
default value to avoid the runtime error. However, what use would the context be
if it didn't have an actual value? If it's just using the default value that's
been provided, then it can't really do much good. 99% of the time that you're
going to be creating and using context in your application, you want your
context consumers (those using `useContext`) to be rendered within a provider
which can provide a useful value.

> Note, there are situations where default values are useful, but most of the
> time they're not necessary or useful.

[The React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#reactcreatecontext)
suggest that providing a default value "can be helpful in testing components in
isolation without wrapping them." While it's true that it allows you to do this,
I disagree that it's better than wrapping your components with the necessary
context. Remember that every time you do something in your test that you don't
do in your application, you reduce the amount of confidence that test can give
you. [There are reasons to do this](/blog/the-merits-of-mocking), but that's not
one of them.

**What's this `CountDispatchContext` thing all about?** I've been playing around
with context for a while, and talking with friends at Facebook who have been
playing around with it for longer and I can tell you that the simplest way to
avoid problems with context (especially when you start calling `dispatch` in
effects) is to split up the state and dispatch in context. Stay with me here!

## The Custom Provider Component

Ok, let's continue. For this context module to be useful _at all_ we need to use
the Provider and expose a component that provides a value. Our component will be
used like this:

```jsx 
function App() {
  return (
    <CountProvider>
      <CountDisplay />
      <Counter />
    </CountProvider>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('⚛️'))
```

So let's make a component that can be used like that:

```jsx
// src/count-context.js
import * as React from 'react'

const CountStateContext = React.createContext()
const CountDispatchContext = React.createContext()

function countReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment': {
      return {count: state.count + 1}
    }
    case 'decrement': {
      return {count: state.count - 1}
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`)
    }
  }
}

function CountProvider({children}) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {count: 0})
  return (
    <CountStateContext.Provider value={state}>
      <CountDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        {children}
      </CountDispatchContext.Provider>
    </CountStateContext.Provider>
  )
}

export {CountProvider}
```
